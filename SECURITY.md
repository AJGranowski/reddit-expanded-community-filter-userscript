# Security Policy

This is a simple userscript. That said, if you do come across a vulnerability with the script itself, feel free to report it.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Use [private vulnerability reporting][draft-advisory-link] instead.
